This document is going to describe what happens documentation-wise upon calling `installPackage`.

Options:
    CheckDocumentation -- this is a boolean; default is true.
    MakeDocumentation -- this is a boolean; default is true.
    RemakeAllDocumenation -- this is a boolean; default is true. Apparently this is a stopgap measure until we get better dependency graphs between documentation nodes. Also, "false" here will apparently confuse users.


*** The first thing that happens is that `loadPackage` is called with (among other things) `LoadDocumentation` set to `true`. The `loadPackage` function is in the `package.m2` file.

Create a list `nodes` of nodes from the raw documentation. [[TODO: Describe what becomes a node.]]
